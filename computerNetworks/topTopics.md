# COMPUTER NETWORK INTERVIEW PREPARATION TOP TOPICS
For any technical interviews, you're expected to know basic computer networking concepts. The below list of topics will help you to fast forward your interview preparation and get ahead. 

### Tips on preparing from this list
Along with topic name, I've also included link where you can read about it. Further start from 1st topic and then keep on moving to next topics. Don't skip the topics in between. I've tried to keep the list in sorted order of their importance/relevance/more probability of being asked in interviews. So go one by one.
