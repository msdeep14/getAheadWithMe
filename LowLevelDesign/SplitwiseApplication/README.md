Design a system that allows for the addition of expenses and split the sam among multiple users or within a group.

Mandatory Requirements:

Create a group. A group can contain two or more users.
Split expenses between users( they may not be a part of a group) or in a group.
The strategy of splitting the amount should be extensible. You can implement equal splitting.
Able to see the pending credit or pending debit in a group or between users. (Let's say between A and B who is going to pay which user and the amount)
Can view the transaction details ( All the expenses which got added) in a group or peer-to-peer.
Bonus points:

Simplify debts ( Let’s say A has to pay 30 to B, B has to pay 30 to C, then in simplify debt view, A has to pay 30 to C directly instead of B ).

Guidelines:

Use any IDE
Write a driver class for demo purposes. Which will execute all the commands in one place in the code and have test cases.
You can print the output in the console. Do not create any UI for the application.
Please prioritize code compilation, execution, and completion
Work on the expected output first and then add bonus features last.
Expectations:

Your code should cover all the mandatory functionalities explained above.
Your code should be executable and clean.
Your code should be properly refactored, and exceptions should be gracefully handled.
Please add any assumptions taken in a README file.
How will you be evaluated?

Separation Of Concerns
Object-Oriented concepts.
Language proficiency.
Scalability
Test Coverage
Concurrency handling(Bonus Points)
